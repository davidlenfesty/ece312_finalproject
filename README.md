# ECE 312 Final Lab Project

This repo contains the code and schematics for @WillardFarmer and I's ECE 312 lab final project.

Blog post coming eventually.


## Design Goals

The final lab was quite open ended, where the groups of students were instructed
to come up with project proposals and assigned a score based on the complexity
and functionality of the project. The requirements were quite open ended.

Our project was to to design a music player that read from an SD card, and
could select songs using an LCD and some buttons.

There's some issues with the firmware (it can get into a "locked" state if you
don't operate it quite correctly), but the main bulk of the project, WAV
playback is perfectly functional.
